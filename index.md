### Answers to Prompts

#### **1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
One of the most interesting topics covered this quarter is optimal interventions in causal inference. While it's straightforward to identify interventions that d-separate the feature set from the target outcome in a causal DAG, selecting interventions that maximize overall benefit under budget constraints introduces a new layer of complexity. This involves finding the least costly intervention strategy while also addressing potential biases caused by protected attributes, ensuring fairness and efficacy.


#### **2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
For my Quarter 2 Project, I would like to investigate optimal interventions in schools to increase employment rates among students. This investigation could explore cost-effective ways to implement changes (e.g., providing counseling resources, skill-building programs) and evaluate how these interventions impact employment outcomes across different demographic groups.

#### **3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
In our current project, we focus heavily on Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) to identify optimal interventions. Moving forward, I would explore incorporating real-world examples to validate the model's predictions. Additionally, we could use the intervened data to build machine learning models that predict outcomes based on intervention strategies, allowing for a hybrid approach that balances optimization and predictive modeling.

#### **4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I am interested in exploring reinforcement learning as an alternative to MIP for optimizing interventions. Reinforcement learning could enable dynamic decision-making by learning which interventions yield the highest cumulative rewards in different scenarios. Additionally, I would like to experiment with causal discovery techniques to better understand the underlying structure of data when the causal DAG is partially unknown, and with fairness-aware machine learning to address biases in outcomes due to protected attributes.
